# evilHangman


Evil Hangman is a CMD/Terminal game which the computer cheats at the classic game Hangman.
Normally, the computer picks a single word and accurately represents it as the human player tries to guess all of the letters in the word.
However in Evil Hangman, the computer instead maintains a list of every word in the English language, then continuously pares down the word list to try to dodge the player's guesses as much as possible!
